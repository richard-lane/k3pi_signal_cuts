data dir
====
To run the scripts in the `scripts/` dir, you will likely have to download the data from lxplus and put it into this
directory (`data/`)

The `k3pi_mass_fit` repo on GitHub contains scripts to download data ROOT files from lxplus - perhaps clone that repo,
download (some of) the files and copy the data to this directory (or just create a symlink).

Alternatively just go into the source file of the script you want to run and edit the appropriate path(s) to point to
whatever data you want to use.
