k3pi_signal_cuts
====
Cut away (some) background from a sample of D0 -> K3pi events.

Recommended Use
---
Assuming you're a new(ish) student doing a $D^0\rightarrow K3\pi$ analysis, here's how I recommend you use this repo:
 - Clone it
 - Follow the instructions in this Readme and in [data/README.md](data/README.md) to download a small amount of data
 - run `create_dumps.py` to create pandas DataFrames for the variables of interest
 - run some of the scripts in the `scripts` dir to check everything works - you should be able to plot histograms of the
   training variables, of $\Delta M$ and $M(D^0)$ for both the signal and background samples.
 - Train the classifier (i haven't implemented this yet)
 - Run some of the cross checks that I haven't implemented either

At this point you will know how to do some signal cuts on a sample of data.
When it comes to the actual analysis it will be impractical to download all the data (it may be practicable to download
all the MC but it might not be), so I'll need to decide what to do about that TODO


Input
----
The scripts in `scripts/` and training code all use pandas DataFrames that can be generated by running the [create_dumps.py](create_dumps.py) script - these require you to have downloaded some data from ROOT files on lxplus and put them in the right place in the `data/` directory.

Some notes on what to do are in the `data/` [README](data/README.md) - but basically you just have to download some ROOT files.

Algorithm
----
I haven't implemented it yet

Cross checks
----
I haven't implemented these either
